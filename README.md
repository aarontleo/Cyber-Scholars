We are using a Raspberry Pi partnered with a bunch of various Vulnerablity Scanners and taking the data from those scans and making an intutive graphic to display to a user what devices are on there network and if anythem are vulnerable. We decided to build this device because everything now in your homes are a smart device or (IOT) which connects out to internet. If you don't know if a device is vulnerable in your home then maybe you are letting wonderful hackers or criminals into your home network.
